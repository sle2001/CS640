# Overview
In this programming assignment, you will modify the emulators that you implemented in project 2, to perform a link-state routing protocol to determine the shortest paths between a fixed, known set of nodes in the lab. The paths between the nodes will be reconfigurable and new routes must stabilize within a fixed time period.

Your emulators will also forward packets from the routetrace application that you will build to the node which is the next hop in the shortest path to a specified destination.

In this assignment, we will not provide you with each and every detail of how you should implement the link-state protocol. Instead, we will specify a set of requirements that your program should satisfy.

As with the first two programming assignments, you are to work in teams and write your code in python and submit your codes into Canvas.
